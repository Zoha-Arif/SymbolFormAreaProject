# 🧠 Symbol Form Area Project

This project investigates how **white matter microstructure** supports **individual differences in reading and math development** in children.

Specifically, we analyzed the relationship between **tissue properties** of structurally connected brain regions — including **Fractional Anisotropy (FA)**, **Mean Diffusivity (MD)**, **Orientation Dispersion Index (ODI)**, and **Neurite Density Index (NDI)** — and cognitive performance in **reading and math**.

Behavioral scores were collected at two timepoints (T1 and T2), and we examined change scores (T2 - T1) to assess **learning-related gains**.

### 🔍 Key Methods

- Statistical analysis of tract-specific microstructure and behavioral scores  
- **Clustering analysis** to identify subgroups of learners based on connectivity patterns  
- Data visualization and figure generation for use in manuscripts and presentations  
- Behavioral variables: reading and math task performance (baseline and change scores)  
- Neuroimaging data: dMRI-derived metrics and tractography-based structural connections

### 📈 Outcome

The analysis provides insight into **how structural brain pathways contribute to symbol-based learning**, and how these neural features relate to individual variability in educational outcomes.

### 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- FSL/FreeSurfer for tract-based analysis
- Custom clustering pipeline for subgroup discovery
